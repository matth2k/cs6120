Chlorophyll is a synthesis-aided compiler that targets a spatial array of ultra-low power scalar cores. Chlorophyll takes a subset of C as input and maps the computation to the hardware in a process not unlike FPGA high-level synthesis. Each core of the GreenArrays GA144 is extremely barebones. They have their own proprietary ISA, it only has 64 18b words of memory, and the cores are not clocked synchronously. While the paper's compilation problem is posed around an extremely niche hardware architecture, the authors' contributions of modular superoptimization is deserving of a close look.

In this blog post, we will breakdown the subproblems of program synthesis and qualitatively judge how effective their synthesizer is at optimizing programs for spatial architectures. To summarize, the main two claims the authors make are (1) that the loss of QoR (quality of results) is worth the increased level of automation and (2) that modular superoptimization is effective enough at finding peephole optimizations like strength reduction and bit-hacks.

## The Compiler

1. Design Partitioning
    * In this step, the locations of data and compute are inferred from the source program. Given some initial partitioning annotations, the compiler synthesizes the rest of the annotations as a type-inference problem. Every high level operation, variable read, and variable write is partitioned with a location index.
2. Placement
    * Given that the design is broken down into logical partitions, the compiler must then place these partitions to specific cores within the layout. The target architecture in this paper is an 8x18 grid of cores that each can communicate to their neighbors to the north, south, east, and west.
3. Code Separation
    * The purpose of a spatial architecture is to break the computation down into separate components that run in parallel, sharing intermediate results. Hence, the compiler needs to transform the source program into separate executables, one for each core. For each partition, code separation filters out the portions of code that are not relevant to it. For the segment of code that pertains to that partition, each variable use and assignment is converted into a `read()` and `send()` operation, respectively.
4. Code Generation
    * Finally, an initial version of machine code is generated for each partition. Then, the bulk of the synthesis-aided optimization occurs. The superoptimizer searches the entire space of instruction reorderings within the boundaries of `read()` and `send()` operations. Great effort went into scaling superoptimization for larger applications. In short, the authors split the machine code into segments and superoptimize along a sliding window.
